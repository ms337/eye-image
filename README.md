# eyeImage

Thought of a way to show a user an image, without actually fully rendering the image, exploiting optical illusions caused due to persistence of vision in the retina. 

By not actually rendering the full image, the user can never take a screenshot of the complete image, however is still able to see the full image  due to the illusion.

Tried and tested the idea out with a simple implementation in C++ using very basic OpenCV.
